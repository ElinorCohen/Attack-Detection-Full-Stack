# Attack Detection Full-Stack

The **Attack Detection Full-Stack** project is a comprehensive web application designed to detect, analyze, and report network attacks. It combines a secure back-end server with a dynamic front-end interface to provide real-time monitoring, threat detection, and user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Security-First Approach**: Implements encryption, secure authentication, and robust protection against SQL injection, XSS attacks, and CSRF attacks.
- **User Management**: Supports user registration, login, and deletion via a user-friendly web interface.
- **Data Crawling & Storage**: Automatically crawls exploit data from [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com), storing it in a MongoDB database for easy access and analysis.
- **Interactive Data Table**: Displays exploit data in a searchable, sortable, and filterable table for enhanced user experience and data exploration.
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: Integrates a secure back-end server with a responsive front-end interface for seamless data processing and user interaction.
